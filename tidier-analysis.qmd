## Tidy analysis in R

-   Packages such as `dplyr` and `ggplot2` are fantastic for data manipulation and visualization

-   They are part of a wider collection of packages known as the "tidyverse"

## Tidy analysis in R

Both `dplyr` and `ggplot2` rely on a concept known as tidy data

-   Each row is an observation
-   Each column is a different variable

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=TRUE}
if(!require(palmerpenguins)) install.packages("palmerpenguins")
library(tidyverse)
library(palmerpenguins)
penguins
```

## Tidy analysis in R

ggplot2 offers a flexible plotting system

```{r message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=TRUE}

ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm,
                     y = bill_depth_mm,col=species)) + geom_point() 
```

## Tidy analysis in R

Can quickly calculate summary statistics from subsets of your data

```{r echo = TRUE}
penguins %>% 
  group_by(species) %>% 
  summarise_all(mean,na.rm=TRUE) %>% 
  select(-island, -sex,-year)

```
 


## What if your data are not tidy?



```{r echo = TRUE}

```

## What if your data are not tidy?

```{r echo = TRUE}


```

```{r}

```
